No additional licensing is required to use *Dataverse for Teams* if the user has a relevant Microsoft 365 license such as E3, E5, or F4. 

You can also create a canvas app in Power Apps Studio using Microsoft Lists as the data source. Microsoft Lists uses the SharePoint connector. No additional licensing is required as SharePoint is standard connector and the license to use SharePoint is seeded from a Microsoft 365 license. 


## PowerBI

Power BI (Business Intelligence) is a business analytics service that delivers insights for analyzing data. It can share those insights through data visualizations which make up reports and dashboards to enable fast, informed decisions. Power BI scales across an organization, and it has built-in governance and security allowing businesses to focus on using data more than managing it.
You can consider Power BI as the analysis and insights leg of Microsoft Power Platform. It takes business data and allows you to display it in ways that makes the most sense to users. A Power BI dashboard could potentially replace a standing meeting to report out on company metrics such as sales data, progress against goals, or employee performance.

## Power Apps Portal
Create a new customer site for your followers with **Power Apps Portals**. You can increase the number of followers with a customer site in Power Apps Portal. However, this will not help you to understand the customers and increase their engagement. 

Portals bring the power of no-code solutions to building externally facing websites. Through the Power Apps interface, you can build an anonymous or authenticated website that allows users to interact with data held in Dataverse. The same drag and drop experience you enjoy when building apps is available to build these rich, interactive websites.

You should recommend Power Apps portal to allow customers to submit their support tickets. Apps created in Power Apps portal can be accessed in any browser or mobile phone. Customers can create the support tickets directly accessing the app via a Desktop browser or using the Power Apps portal mobile application. 

You cannot create a Power Apps portal for the HR department to manage user identity in Microsoft Dataverse. You can create a Power Apps portal to extend Dataverse and instruct the HR department to manage user table in Dataverse. However, user table is not integrated with Azure AD. You need to implement an additional Power Automate flow to create users when new records are created in Dataverse. 


## Power Virtual Agents 

Power Virtual Agents enables anyone to create powerful chatbots using a guided, no-code graphical interface, without the need for data scientists or developers.
It minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom solution by empowering subject matter experts to build and maintain their own conversational solutions. Power Virtual Agents is part of Microsoft Power Platform, therefore integration into existing systems is streamlined with out-of-the-box integration with Power Automate and its ecosystems of hundreds of connectors. Users can enable chatbots to perform an action by simply calling a Power Automate flow. Flows help users automate activities or call back end systems. Users can utilize existing flows that have been created in their Power Apps environment or they can create a flow within Power Virtual Agents authoring canvas.

You can create and send invoices to customers via email. You can recommend Power Automate to automate the process of creating and sending invoices to customers, without the need for developing custom code. 

Power Automate flows and UI flows cannot interact with customers on the power app portal. 

You can automate the user creation via email with a Power Automate flow. You can use more than two hundred built-in connectors with Power Automate. These connectors include the Offce 365 Outlook connector and the Azure AD connector. You can create a workflow that is triggered when you receive an email from the HR department, read the user information contained in the email and create a user in Azure AD with the Azure AD connector. 

**Triggers** are only used in Power Automate and prompt a flow to begin. Triggers can be time based, such as a flow which begins every day at 8:00 am, or they could be based off of an action like creating a new row in a table or receiving an email. You will always need a trigger to tell your workflow when to run.

**Actions** are used in Power Automate and Power Apps. Actions are prompted by the user or a trigger and allow interaction with your data source by some function. For example, an action would be sending an email in your workflow or app or writing a new line to a data source.

## Azure Functions 
To use Azure Functions, business users should have software development skills in order to perform these tasks. 

## Connectors

Connectors enable you to connect apps, data, and devices in the cloud. Consider connectors the bridge across which information and commands travel. There are more than 275 connectors for Microsoft Power Platform, enabling all of your data and actions to connect cohesively. Examples of popular connectors include Salesforce, Office 365, Twitter, Dropbox, Google services, and more.

Connectors are the bridges from your data source to your app, workflow, or dashboard. Microsoft Power Platform has more than 275 connectors available to common data sources. Connectors are divided into standard and premium. Some popular standard connectors are SharePoint, Outlook, and YouTube. Premium connectors require additional licensing for your app and/or users. A few premium connectors are SQL Server, Survey Monkey, and Mail Chimp. The connector reference in the summary and resources unit lists all connectors and whether they are considered standard or premium. You can also use AppSource to source and install apps and use the connectors to non-Microsoft services.

Connectors can provide input and output between the data source and Power Platform, which can accelerate the delivery of Microsoft Power Platform business solutions. For instance, using Dynamics 365 apps such as Customer Service, you can set up Power Automate to notify users when specific customer types are added. Or you can use a SharePoint document library to store files that are fed into Power Apps to manage and distribute. Microsoft also provides connectors to their Azure services, providing advanced AI techniques to do tasks such as reading text off images or cognitive services like recognizing faces in images.

All Microsoft Power Platform business solutions can be used and implemented into Microsoft 365 apps such as Teams. This allows users to play Power Apps within Teams or run Power Automate from actions and events within Teams.

Microsoft Power Platform is made powerful by its ability to leverage data across many platforms. To do this, components of Microsoft Power Platform use connectors. You can think of connectors as a bridge from your data source to your app or workflow which allows information to be conveyed back and forth. Connectors allow you to extend your business solutions across platforms and add functionality for your users.

Connectors are used to connect your data source to your Power Apps apps, Power Automate workflows, or Power Bl dashboard. 
You can use a custom connector to integrate Power Platform with services without built-in support. You could use a custom connector to integrate a third- 
party application with Power Platform. However, you can use the built-in SQL Server connector to access this application's data. 

To integrate with an internal third-party API, you need to develop a custom connector yourselves - this requires developers

You should use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies to control the use of connectors to data and services. DLP policies control which connectors can be used together in canvas apps and flows. In a DLP, you define which connectors are for business data and which are for non-business data. For instance, you can define SharePoint as a business connector and DropBox as non-business connector. This will prevent anyone in an environment from sending SharePoint documents and putting them in Dropbox.

Connectors can be classified as either Business or Non-Business in the context of your organization. Connectors that host business-use data should be classified as Business and connectors that host personal-use data should be classified as Non-Business. Any connectors that you want to restrict usage of across one or more environments should be classified as Blocked. When a new policy is created, all connectors are defaulted to the Non-Business group. From there they can be moved to Business or Blocked based on your preference. You can manage connectors when you create or modify the properties of a DLP policy from the Microsoft Power Platform admin center. These affect Microsoft Power Platform canvas apps and Power Automate flows. To create a DLP policy, you need to be a tenant admin or have the Environment Admin role.

## Custom Connectors ##
While Microsoft Power Platform offers more than 200 connectors, you also have the option to build a custom connector. This will allow you to extend your app by calling a publicly available API, or a custom API you are hosting in a cloud provider, such as Azure. API stands for Application Programming Interface and holds a series of functions available for developers. Connectors work by sending information back and forth across these APIs and gathering available functions into Power Apps or Power Automate. Because these connectors are function-based, they will call specific functions in the underlying service of the API to return the corresponding data.

An advantage of building custom connectors is that they can be used in different platforms, such as Power Apps, Power Automate, and Azure Logic Apps.

## Data Sources
In order to understand the types of connectors and what you can do with them, you must first understand the types of data sources to which they connect. The two types of data sources are tabular and function-based.

Tabular data - A tabular data source is one that returns data in a structured table format. Power Apps can directly read and display these tables through galleries, forms, and other controls. Additionally, if the data source supports it, Power Apps can create, edit, and delete data from these data sources. Examples include Microsoft Dataverse, SharePoint, and SQL Server.

Function-based data - A function-based data source is one that uses functions to interact with the data source. These functions can be used to return a table of data but offer more extensive action such as the ability to send an email, update permissions, or create a calendar event. Examples include Office 365 Users, Project Online, and Azure Blob Storage.

Both of these data source types are commonly used to bring data and additional functionality to your solutions.

As you can see, connecting to data sources allows you to integrate disparate parts of your business solutions to build them out cohesively.


## [Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-common-data-service/) 

Microsoft Dataverse is a scalable data service and app platform which lets users securely store and manage data from multiple sources and integrate that data in business applications using a common data model to ensure ease and consistency to users. Microsoft Dataverse is the common currency that enables the components of Microsoft Power Platform to work together. It’s the foundation that enables the consolidation, display, and manipulation of data.

You can use Dataverse to store business data used by your applications. The data is organized as tables. A table is a set of rows used to store data. 

You can use Dataverse to store your data in a set of standard or custom tables used by business applications. But if the third-party application uses SQL Server to store the data, then you do not need to replicate this data in Dataverse to create the sales dashboard. 

You should use Microsoft Dataverse to create tables for data. Dataverse is a data store that provides data and services to apps such as Power Apps and model-driven apps. Dataverse contains a set of standard tables that you can extend by creating your own tables, columns, and relationships to meet your business requirements. 

You should recommend Microsoft Dataverse to store support tickets and enforce business rules. You can store the tickets created in Power Apps portal to Dataverse and apply business rules to ensure data validation across every app or flow that uses these tickets. 

You can use Dataverse to store business data used by your applications. This data is organized as tables. A table is a set of rows used to store data. Data from 
Dynamics 365 is also stored within Dataverse and you can build apps using these tables. However, you cannot notify a user when a new sales order is created. 

You can use Microsoft Dataverse as a single data source to standardize business data across multiple solutions. You can use Dataverse to store your data in a set of standard or custom tables that are used by business applications. Dataverse uses the Common Data Model (CDM), a set of standardized, extensible data schemas published by Microsoft and partners to facilitate data interoperability across multiple solutions. 

You need to create a Dataverse database to be able to use some Power Platform components. You need to create a Dataverse database to use services like Al Builder and Power Apps portals that require constant data access. 

You cannot provision a Dataverse database in your own data center to integrate on-premises solutions. Dataverse is offered only as a service managed by Microsoft. You cannot provision a Dataverse database as an on-premises solution. You need to use an on-premises data gateway to integrate data from on-premises solutions with Dataverse.

You should not create a canvas app in Power Apps Studio using Dataverse as the data source. Dataverse is a premium connector that requires additional licensing to use. 

You should not create a **model-driven app**. Model-driven apps require Microsoft Dataverse, which is a **premium connector** and will require additional licensing

You should assign a security role to the users. To access data within Microsoft Dataverse, a user must have a security role assigned to them in Dataverse that gives them the appropriate privileges on the entities. 

### Key Takeaways
1. Microsoft Dataverse uses standard tables, columns, and relationships to help you build powerful, scalable data solutions.
2. Make your data work for you so that you can get the most of it by splitting it up into logical chunks.
3. Using Dataverse, you can break your data into various environments to better manage and secure important information.


## Business Rules
In Microsoft Dataverse you can define business rules. Business rules allow you to apply and maintain business logic at the data layer instead of the app layer. Put more simply, if you create business rules in Microsoft Dataverse, they are in effect regardless of where you interact with the data.

For example, business rules can be used in canvas and model-driven apps to set or clear values in one or many columns in a table. They can also be used to validate stored data or show error messages. Model-driven apps can use business rules to show or hide columns, enable or disable columns, and create recommendations based on business intelligence.

Business rules give you a powerful way to enforce rules, set values, or validate data regardless of the form that is used to input data. Additionally, business rules are effective in helping to increase the accuracy of data, simplify application development, and streamline the forms presented to end users.

The following business rule actions can be used by canvas and model-driven apps:

* Set column values
* Clear column values
* Validate data and show error messages

Model-driven apps can also use business rules to:
* Show or hide columns (model-driven apps only)
* Enable or disable columns (model-driven apps only)
* Create business recommendations based on business intelligence (model-driven apps only)

## AppSource third-party app 
You can use AppSource as an online store for business applications. You can publish or discover new add-ins for Power Platform, like custom connectors or Power Bl apps. But if the third-party application publisher does not support Power Platform directly, then it is highly improbable that you will find an add-in to integrate with the application. 

## Al Builder 

AI Builder lets users and developers add AI capabilities to the workflows and Power Apps they create and use. AI Builder is a turnkey solution that allows you to easily add intelligence to your workflows and apps and predict outcomes to help improve business performance without writing code.
