## Event-driven flow:
Use an EDF to check the arrival of a file in the FTP folder. You would build an event-driven flow so that whenever new files arrive in the FTP folder, it will trigger an action. 

## Template flow:
Use a Template Flow to move the files from the FTP folder to OneDrive. Once this flow is triggered by an event-driven flow, it will copy the files from the FTP folder to OneDrive. You already use the 
available templates flow to save time debugging and error handling.
