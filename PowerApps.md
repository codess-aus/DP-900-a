# Demonstrate the capabilities of Power Apps (15-20%)

If you create a model-driven app and share the app with users but find users cannot access the app. You need to enable users to access the app by assigning a **security role** to the users. This is not the same as adding the users to a Security Group. **Security groups** are used in Power Platform to enable access to environments. They are not used to give access to individual apps. 

## Canvas app: 
Simple apps with a highly customizable user interface layout. A canvas app lets you have complete control over the app layout. It also allows you to drag and drop elements to a 
canvas and use expressions to specify simple logic. 

## Model-driven app 
Complex business process apps with simple user interfaces. Model-driven apps can automatically generate the application layout for your business data and processes stored 
in Microsoft Dataverse. You create a model-driven app by modelling the necessary business data your app needs to define a consistent business process. 










## Dashboard. A dashboard is a Power BI compnonent that displays a single page with interactive visuals, text, and graphics. You can customize the dashboard interface layout, but you cannot interact with a dashboard as an application.
