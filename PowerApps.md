# Demonstrate the capabilities of Power Apps (15-20%)

If you create a model-driven app and share the app with users but find users cannot access the app. You need to enable users to access the app by assigning a **security role** to the users. This is not the same as adding the users to a Security Group. **Security groups** are used in Power Platform to enable access to environments. They are not used to give access to individual apps.
