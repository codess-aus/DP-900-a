## Demonstrate the capabilities of Power BI (15-20%)

## Power BI Desktop 
Use Power BI Desktop to create reports and connect them to SharePoint lists. 
You should use Power BI Desktop to perform tasks like creating reports, calculating columns and configuring security settings. 
Power BI Desktop is a complete tool that creates reports, visualizations and data modelling. 

You should use Power Desktop to shape and combine data. Power BI Desktop allows you to share links to different data sources and to shape and model the data before publishing the model to Power BI Service. 

## Power BI Service 

Use [Power BI Service](https://app.powerbi.com) to publish the report and share it within your organization or with specific people. 
With Power BI Service you can create your reports in the cloud environment. 

You should use Power BI Service to perform tasks like configuring sharing and security settings and creating reports. 
Power BI Service is primarily used to share, publish and collaborate within pur organization, but it also includes limited data modelling capabilities.

You should use Power Service to create dashboards. You can create visualizations and reports in both Power Bl Desktop and Power Service, but you can only create and share dashboards in Power BI service. 


## Power Query:
You should use Power Query to connect to and transform data. Although you can use many components in Power BI to connect and retrieve data, all the tools use Power Query for data cleansing and data transformation. 

## Power BI Mobile App
Power BI Mobile App is used to access your report hosted in Power BI Service. 

You should not use Power BI Mobile. Power BI Mobile is used to display Power 81 reports and dashboards. 

## Dashboard. 
Dashboard is a collection of visuals from a Power BI report hosted in Power AI Service. 

Dashboards contain visualizations from your reports. You can share dashboards with other users. 

You should recommend a dashboard to display the company's KPls 
A dashboard is a single page with interactive visuals, text, and graphics called tiles. 
A tile's contents comes from one or more reports and one or more datasets. 
Because the dashboard is composed of only one page, you should include only the most important information, like the KPls used to monitor business performance. 

You should recommend a dashboard to configure alerts when a specific threshold target is met With a dashboard, the managers can configure a data alert on the tiles that they are most interested in. For example, a sales manager can configure an alert when the total sales are above the expected. Data alerts are available only for the user who created them. 

You cannot apply filters to a dashboard. 

Dashboards are created in the Power BI Service, not in Power BI Desktop. In Power BI Service, you add visualizations from your reports to dashboards.

## Report
You should recommend a report to analyze sales charts filtered by region. A report is composed of one or more visuals that represent different findings and insights from a single dataset. A report can have multiple tabs to better explore the information on a dataset. 
You can apply filters, slices, and highlights to discover specific data or patterns, like filtering sales for a specific region. 

The Report view contains one or more pages where you add and edit your visualizations. 

## Model
You should use the Model view to show a visual view of all the entities from your data sources. 
The model view (also known as the Relationships view) contains all entities, columns, and relationships in a graphical view. 
You can edit relationships, change their direction and cardinality, and create new relationships as necessary. 
Relationships are important for visualizations because they allow data to be grouped, aggregated and linked. 

## Data
The Data view contains tables and columns in the right hand pane, with the data records in the main pane, allowing you to inspect your data after it has been loaded into the model. 

## Workspace
Workspaces are containers for data models, reports, and dashboards in the Power BI service. When you publish from Power BI Desktop to Power BI service, you select a workspace to hold your analytics.
